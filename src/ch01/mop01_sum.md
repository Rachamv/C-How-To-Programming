1.6 (Gender Neutrality) Write the steps of a manual procedure to process a text para-
graph and replace gender-specific words with gender-neutral ones. Assuming you’ve
been given a list of gender-specific words and their gender-neutral replacements (e.g.,
replace “wife” or “husband” with “spouse,” replace “man” or “woman” with “person,”
replace “daughter” or “son” with “child,” and so on), explain the procedure you’d use
to read through a paragraph of text and manually perform these replacements. How
might your procedure generate a strange term like “woperchild” and how might you
modify your procedure to avoid this possibility? In Chapter 3, you’ll learn that a more
formal computing term for “procedure” is “algorithm,” and that an algorithm specifies
the steps to be performed and the order in which to perform them.
1.7 (Self-Driving Cars) Just a few years back, the notion of driverless cars on our
streets would have seemed impossible (in fact, our spell-checking software doesn’t
recognize the word “driverless”). Many of the technologies you’ll study in this book
are making self-driving cars possible. They’re already common in some areas.
a) If you hailed a taxi and a driverless taxi stopped for you, would you get into
the back seat? Would you feel comfortable telling it where you want to go and
trusting that it would get you there? What safety measures would you want in
place? What would you do if the car headed off in the wrong direction?
b) What if two self-driving cars approached a one-lane bridge from opposite di-
rections? What protocol should they go through to determine which car
should proceed?
c) What if you’re behind a car stopped at a red light, the light turns green, and
the car doesn’t move? You honk, and nothing happens. You get out of your
car and notice that there’s no driver. What would you do?
d) If a police officer pulls over a speeding self-driving car in which you’re the
only passenger, who—or what entity—should pay the ticket?
e) One serious concern with self-driving vehicles is that they could potentially
be hacked. Someone could set the speed high (or low), which could be dan-
gerous. What if they redirect you to a destination other than what you want?
1.8 (Research: Reproducibility) A crucial concept in data-science studies is repro-
ducibility, which helps others (and you) reproduce your results. Research reproduc-
ibility and list the concepts used to create reproducible results in data-science studies.
1.9 (Research: Artificial General Intelligence) One of the most ambitious goals in
the field of AI is to achieve artificial general intelligence—the point at which machine
intelligence would equal human intelligence. Research this intriguing topic. When is
this forecast to happen? What are some key ethical issues this raises? Human intelli-
gence seems to be stable over long periods. Powerful computers with artificial general
intelligence could conceivably (and quickly) evolve intelligence far beyond that of hu-
mans. Research and discuss the issues this raises.
1.10 (Research: Intelligent Assistants) Many companies now offer computerized in-
telligent assistants, such as IBM Watson, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Google Assistant
and Microsoft Cortana. Research these and others and list uses that can improve peo-
ple’s lives. Research privacy and ethics issues for intelligent assistants. Locate amusing
intelligent-assistant anecdotes.
1.11 (Research: AI in Health Care) Research the rapidly growing field of AI big-data
applications in health care. For example, suppose a diagnostic medical application
had access to every x-ray that’s ever been taken and the associated diagnoses—that’s
surely big data. “Deep Learning” computer-vision applications can work with this
“labeled” data to learn to diagnose medical problems. Research deep learning in di-
agnostic medicine and describe some of its most significant accomplishments. What
are some ethical issues of having machines instead of human doctors performing
medical diagnoses? Would you trust a machine-generated diagnosis? Would you ask
for a second opinion?
1.12 (Research: Privacy and Data Integrity Legislation) In the Preface, we mentioned
HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and the California Con-
sumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States and GDPR (General Data Protection
Regulation) for the European Union. Laws like these are becoming more common and
stricter. Investigate each of these laws and their effects on your privacy.
1.13 (Research: Personally Identifiable Information) Protecting users personally
identifiable information (PII) is an important aspect of privacy. Research and com-
ment on this issue.
1.14 (Research: Big Data, AI and the Cloud—How Companies Use These Technolo-
gies) For a major organization of your choice, research how they may be using each of
the following technologies: AI, big data, the cloud, mobile, natural-language process-
ing, speech recognition, speech synthesis, database, machine learning, deep learning, re-
inforcement learning, Hadoop, Spark, Internet of Things (IoT) and web services.
1.15 (Research: Raspberry Pi and the Internet of Things) It’s now possible to have a
computer at the heart of just about any device and to connect those devices to the In-
ternet. This has led to the Internet of Things (IoT), which interconnects billions of de-
vices. The Raspberry Pi is an economical computer often at the heart of IoT devices.
Research the Raspberry Pi and some of the many IoT applications in which it’s used.
1.16 (Research: The Ethics of Deep Fakes) Artificial-intelligence technologies make it
possible to create deep fakes—realistic fake videos of people that capture their appear-
ance, voice, body motions and facial expressions. You can have them say and do what-
ever you specify. Research the ethics of deep fakes. What would happen if you turned
on your TV and saw a deep-fake video of a prominent government official or newscaster
reporting that a nuclear attack was about to happen? Research Orson Welles and his
“War of the Worlds” radio broadcast of 1938, which created mass panic.
1.17 (Research: Blockchain—A World of Opportunity) Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin
and Ethereum are based on a technology called blockchain that has seen explosive
growth over the last few years. Research blockchain’s origin, applications and how it
came to be used as the basis for cryptocurrencies. Research other major applications of
blockchain. Over the next many years, there will be extraordinary opportunities for
software developers who thoroughly understand blockchain applications development.
1.18 (Research: Secure C and the CERT Division of Carnegie Mellon University’s
Software Engineering Institute) Experience has shown that it’s challenging to build
industrial-strength systems that stand up to attacks. Such attacks can be instanta-
neous and global in scope. Many of the world’s largest companies, government agen-
cies, and military organizations have had their systems compromised. Such
vulnerabilities often come from simple programming issues. Building security into
software from the start of its development can significantly reduce vulnerabilities.
Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute (SEI) created CERT
(https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm) to analyze and re-
spond promptly to attacks. CERT publishes and promotes secure coding standards
to help C programmers and others implement industrial-strength systems that avoid
the programming practices that leave systems vulnerable to attacks. The CERT stan-
dards evolve as new security issues arise. The SEI CERT C Coding Standard is con-
cerned with “hardening” computer systems and applications to resist attacks.
Research CERT and discuss their accomplishments and current challenges. To help
you focus on secure C coding practices, Chapters 2–12 and 14 contain Secure C Cod-
ing sections that present some key issues and techniques and provide links and refer-
ences so that you can continue learning.
1.19 (Research: IBM Watson) IBM is partnering with tens of thousands of compa-
nies—including our publisher, Pearson Education—across a wide range of industries.
Research some of IBM Watson’s key accomplishments and the kinds of challenges
IBM and its partners are addressing.
